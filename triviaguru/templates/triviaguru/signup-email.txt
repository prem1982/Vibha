Thank you for registering. Your participation in this event will help support

(http://vibha.org/projects). With generous support from patrons like you, we
have been able to positively impact the lives of more than 100,000
disadvantaged children since 1991. We hope that you will continue to support
Vibha as we strive to reach many more children who are in dire need of care.
Following are a few more easy ways you can help us provide care for
underprivileged children.

1. Sign up for our Help Them Grow program and donate an amount of your
   choice monthly. More details at http://www.vibha.org/htg

   through the Vibha Dream Registry. More details at
