Thank you for registering in this tournament. Your participation in this
tournament will go a long way in helping Vibha support grassroots level
initiatives in India and the US (http://vibha.org/projects). With generous
support from patrons like you, we have been able to positively impact the
lives of more than 100,000 disadvantaged children since 1991. We hope that
you will continue to support Vibha as we strive to reach many more children
who are in dire need of care.  Following are a few more easy ways you can
help us provide care for underprivileged children.

1. Sign up for our Help Them Grow program and donate an amount of your
   choice monthly. More details at http://www.vibha.org/htg

2. You can also support Vibha while celebrating successes in your life
   through the Vibha Dream Registry. More details at

Sincerely,
Vibha Austin Volunteers
