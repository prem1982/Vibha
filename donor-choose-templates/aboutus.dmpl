<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>"Children are the living messages we send to a time we will not see"</strong></em></p>
<p>India, by one count has</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>18 million</strong>* street children </li>
        <li>over <strong>22 million</strong>* child laborers </li>
            <li>Nearly <strong>20%</strong>** of the children 6-14 years old have no access to primary education. </li>
                <li>Less than <strong>45%</strong>** receive the immunization required to protect them from deadly illnesses. </li>
                    <li><strong>Half the children</strong> do not get enough food everyday and are chronically or acutely undernourished. </li>
                    </ul>
