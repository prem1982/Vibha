Dear Sir/ Madam,

We are sending this letter to inform you that we have wired ${{disbursal.amount}}
on {{disbursal.disbursed_date}} from our account in Citi Bank to your account in
{{organization.bank_name}}.

Please note that this project has been approved in US dollars.  Hence, each
installment amount in INR might be different due to the fluctuating exchange
rates.

We require that a receipt be sent for each installment once it is received.
This receipt can be emailed to office@vibha.org or faxed to 775-593-1061. If
the organization does not have an email address, please mail the receipt to
the following address:

Help Them Grow, Inc dba Vibha
1030 E EL Camino Real #424
Sunnyvale, CA 94087

It is also mandatory to submit a quarterly project report before the next
installment is released. If the project does not meet the requirements
mentioned in the project proposal, Vibha has the right to discontinue the
project and cancel future disbursals.

Sincerely,

Vivek Sharma
