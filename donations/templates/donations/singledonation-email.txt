Dear {{ model.first_name }},

On behalf of Vibha, I would like to thank you very much for your
contribution! The official receipt of your donation can be found at
the end of this email.

Your donation goes a long way. A new book to write in, a new pair of
clothes, an additional teacher for the classroom, a nutritious meal,
or even that painful immunization shot - these are some of the ways
your donation will make a difference in the life of a child.

We look forward to your continued support as we strive to reach many
more children who are in dire need of care. Please let me know if you
have any questions/feedback regarding this donation or our work at
Vibha.

With best regards,

Rajesh Haridas,
Chief Operating Officer,
Vibha (Help Them Grow Inc)
